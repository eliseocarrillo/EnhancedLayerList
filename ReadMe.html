Built with Web App Builder 2.1

Example demo site of widget is posted here: http://sagiscloud.thempc.org/elayerlist/

The widget is located in eLayerList folder of this WAB 2.1 site in the Widgets folder. Files that were modified are widgets\eLayerList\PopupMenu.js  and PopupMenuInfo.js

Enhanced Layer List adds metadata Dojo dialogs to display the Description and Copyright text fields from the REST service. 
This replaces the standard out-of-the-box function that opens a new tab or window to display the Esri REST Service page when a user clicks the "Description" item in the '...' menu on a layer in the Layer List widget, and displays these dialogs instead. This is more friendly to the end user.

Also includes modification to the LayerListView.js file to autoexpand layerlist based on posts from Robert Scheitlin et al in https://geonet.esri.com/thread/160914
